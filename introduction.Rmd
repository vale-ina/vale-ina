**Research Question:** How will the Twitter behavior of Boris Johnson and Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez compare and contrast?” 

The scope of our project is to compare tweets by Boris Johnson and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) and develop an algorithm that is able to predict whether a given tweet was more likely tweeted by one or the other. 

We choose to compare these two individuals because although they are both widely-known politicians, they are reasonably different from each other in their views and thus in the topics and opinions that they share on social media. This is based on a number of factors such as their different political affiliation, their different roles in politics, the fact that they operate in two different countries. 

As the prime minister of the UK, Boris Johnson is heavily involved in international affairs. Although not the President of the US, Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) has experienced a great deal of social media attention as a young congresswoman and has weighed in on international issues as well. In addition, Johnson and Ocasio-Cortez are seen by the public as more than politicians, each has become a personality and a representative of politics in their respective nations. As Twitter can be used to say a wide variety of things, both political and not, we aimed to investigate how these two similar yet very different people use the platform. 

In the next Sections, we report our methodology, results, and conclusions in more detail.
