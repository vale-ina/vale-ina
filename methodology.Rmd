### Code for Step (i)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

#recovering tweets from our chosen people: Boris Johnson and AOC
library(rtweet)
library(dplyr)

bj <- get_timeline("BorisJohnson",  n=3200)
aoc <- get_timeline("aoc", n=3200)

#selecting only relevant variables ('select')
#selecting only 200 rows from each person (as in the class exercise)

bj %>%  filter(is_retweet=="FALSE") %>% 
  select("screen_name","text") %>%  #, "created_at"
  head(200) -> bj2

aoc %>%  filter(is_retweet=="FALSE") %>% 
  select("screen_name","text") %>%  #, "created_at"
  head(200) -> aoc2

#creating one file with tweets from both people
tweets_hw9 <- union(bj2,aoc2)

tweets_hw9 %>% mutate(id = row_number()) %>% rename(author = screen_name, status = text) -> tweets_hw9_v0.2

#exporting file as .csv
write.csv(tweets_hw9_v0.2, file = "tweets_hw9_tidy.csv")
