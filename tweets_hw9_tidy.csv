"337","AOC","(Care much about a given issue, that is)

Alternatively, if your rep sounds on the fence or hasn‚Äôt defined their stance on an issue yet, calls from constituents really can make a difference in nudging them to come out on an issue. Puts it higher on the priority list.",337
"338","AOC","If you feel your rep is doing the right thing, calling to thank them shows their district notices &amp; appreciates their stance.

Knowing constituents are watching &amp; care creates positive pressure to stay strong. When you don‚Äôt think your constituents care much, it‚Äôs easier to cave.",338
"339","AOC","The reason it‚Äôs helpful to call YOUR rep even when they are doing the right thing is because reps are under a TON of pressure all the time. Sometimes it‚Äôs political pressure to change a stance, but sometimes it‚Äôs also time pressure vs other leg and you have to choose priorities.",339
