In conclusion, we find that our algorithm is able to predict whether a given tweet was more likely tweeted by Boris Johnson or AOC with an accuracy of about 70%. This is both consistent with the results from the Confusion Matrices and with our manual test. We also found that the algorithm tends to break when we test it with tweets from unrelated users, as it attributes them to the same person (AOC).

This work has been done as part of a class project and itâ€™s the result of teamwork by Nicolle Belaunde, Valentina Cafarelli (myself), Jenifer M. Nemoda, Samira Okudo, and Jonathan Zur. 

Our predictive algorithm is adapted from one of the models we used in class (Lecture 12).
